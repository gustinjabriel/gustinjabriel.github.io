Do you agree with that statement? I do, and I'm a marketer.

Consider how you communicate and consume content. What frustrations do you have with those channels (e.g. telephone, social, telephone)? Below are my frustrations, which are mostly due to marketers.

* Telephone...telemarketers
* Social...ads (e.g. Facebook video ads that appear 60 seconds into your 180 second video)
* Email...spam
* TV...ads (everyone looks at their phone when they come on)
* Voice...itâ€™s coming
* Text...still sacred

How do we fix this?
