Do you agree with the statement above? I do, and I'm a marketer.

Consider advancements in communication and the frustrations you have with them. Below are my frustrations, which are mostly due to marketers.

* Telephone...telemarketers
* Social...ads (e.g. Facebook video ads that appear 60 seconds into your 180 second video)
* Email...spam
* TV...ads (everyone looks at their phone when they come on)
* Voice...itâ€™s coming
* Text...still sacred

How do we fix this?
